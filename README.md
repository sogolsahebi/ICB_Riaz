- **Objective:** Investigates how nivolumab (anti-PD-1) therapy affects tumor evolution in melanoma, focusing on changes in mutation load, immune cell activity, and T-cell responses, providing insights into mechanisms of treatment response and resistance
- **Summary of Dataset:** Conducted whole-exome, transcriptome, and/or T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing on 68 patients who received anti-PD1. A decrease in detectable mutations and expansion of T-cell clones were associated with a response to anti-PD1. Pre-therapy expression analysis identified pre-existing immune programs in responders and expression footprints of 'hot' versus 'cold' tumors based on prior immunotherapy exposure.
